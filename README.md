## About Me

I'm native to Oregon. I went to [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/) for a
[bachelors](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/academics/undergraduates/electrical-computer-engineering) and
[masters](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/current-students/graduate/ece-program) in
[Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/).
I worked at [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/) in Beaverton Oregon (just outside of Portland)
on [next generation ARM cpus and systems-on-chip (SoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Denver),
before moving to Charleston, South Carolina and changing career paths a little bit.

I began working at [Snagajob](https://www.snagajob.com/about/), specifically the
[PeopleMatter](https://www.peoplematter.com)
team, as a senior software engineer in 2017. I then transitioned to be a member of the [JobBoard.io](https://www.jobboard.io) team at
[ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/hiring/technology). I'm now a lead software engineer at [Goldbelly](https://www.goldbelly.com).

You can see my [resume](https://truggeri.com/resume/) for more details.

### Go Sudoku

![Go Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Go-0084c0?style=flat&labelColor=00ADD8&logo=go&logoColor=white)

When I'm learning a new language, a sudoku solver is my go-to application. This implementation uses Go and has a test and benchmark.

### Ruby Sudoku

![Ruby Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Ruby-81302f?style=flat&labelColor=9a1c19&logo=ruby&logoColor=white)

Similar to the Go implementation, the Ruby sudoku solver was made to help me experiment with Ruby when I was learning. It now includes an RSpec test suite.
